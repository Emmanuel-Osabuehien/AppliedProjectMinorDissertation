## Introduction<a name = "intro"></a>

Hello, this repository exists to contain the files necessary for my Meal Planning Web Application built using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS and my dissertation. 

## Overview<a name = "overview"></a>

This is a Meal Planning Web Application which was developed using a MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS). The function is to provide users with a multi-user. functioning web application which allows them to plan out their daily meals, keep track of dietary requirements, provide nutrional education, plan out shopping list and keep track of their calories. The application also allows users to register and login to an account where this functionality will then become available for users to perform the aforementioned tasks. Users can search for meals that the application has provided, which will then allow them to add/delete from a list of meals which the user can then view. Users will also be provided with a table full of graphs which provided information regarding various diets and nutrional education which users can select to follow. Users can also create their personal ingredients list adding items and the quantity of said item to a list which they can utilize when they plan to complete their shopping. Users can also calculate their BMR (Basic Metabolic Rate) and calories needed based on the users personal details such as height, weight, gender, etc.
